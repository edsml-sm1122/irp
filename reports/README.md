Before submission, please ensure your report complies with **IRP2023 guidelines**. Commit your project plan, final report, and presentation (**each as a single PDF**) to **this directory** (`reports/`). The **file name** must be (all **lowercase**):

| deliverable | filename |
| - | - |
| project plan | `sm1122-project-plan.pdf` |
| final report | `sm1122-final-report.pdf` |
| presentation | `sm1122-presentation.pdf` |

As a final step, **ensure the corresponding workflow on GitHub Actions (e.g., `project-plan`, `final-report`, or `presentation`) is passing** - workflow badges are in the table above. Please note that it usually takes some time for the badge status to update. You can check the status of the workflow in `Actions` tab or by refreshing this page after several minutes.
