# Surrogate Modeling for Hybrid Wave Downscaling using MLP and LSTM

## Introduction

This repository houses the codebase and additional resources for the research conducted on utilizing Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) as surrogate models in the domain of hybrid wave downscaling. The objective is to predict Significant Wave Height (SWH) at coastlines from wave-related parameters at offshore 25m contour points. The research investigates the model's performance and generalization abilities across different spatial and temporal scales.
